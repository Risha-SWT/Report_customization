It is possible that the genomic region where a disease causing mutation exists in the proband was not captured in the current test and therefore was not detected. Additionally, it is possible that a particular genetic abnormality may not be recognized as the underlying cause of the genetic disorder due to incomplete scientific knowledge about the function of all genes in the human genome and the impact of variants in those genes.
